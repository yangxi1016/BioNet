Chemicals are derived from PubChem. As described in the STITCH paper,
we merge salt forms and isomers. However, since STITCH 3, isomeric
compounds can also be investigated separately. In the download files,
the following convention holds:

CIDs / CID0... - this is a stereo-specific compound, and the suffix is the
PubChem compound id.

CIDm / CID1... - this is a "flat" compound, i.e. with merged stereo-isomers
The suffix (without the leading "1") is the PubChem compound id.

(Note that the download files contain the prefixes CIDs/CIDm, while the API
still returns CID0/CID1.)
